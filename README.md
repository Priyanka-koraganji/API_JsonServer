For Mock Data-- 
I have used Chat GPT to generate.
Go to chat.openai.com, then sign up
In the prompt ask - Give me a list of 5 fields with a product entity on an e-commerce site selling electronic items
And u can add id field and if everything is fine, u can to generate a JSON file.
On our project, create a folder and add db.json file and copy the json data in object format under "products" key.
Install json-server module
In package.json file add script to run json-server
Now You can test the routes in postman or Thunder-client VS Code extension.
Here you can read, add or delete data.
